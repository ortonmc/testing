CHAPTER I.

WHAT THE SNOWDROPS SEEMED TO BE.

"YOU must not touch them,
Watch! Have I not told
you before that the poor
rabbits are not to be tormented?"

The speaker was a little
maiden, with a quantity of light silken hair; and
as the sweet-toned voice raised this command to
the large dog at her feet, her face assumed a
sedate and reproving expression, rather at
variance with her extreme youth.
!!!!! 010.txt !!!!!

The dog, too, was very young, not full grown
evidently, therefore more difficult to govern, but
he seemed to understand his little mistress upon
this occasion; for he stretched himself upon
the grass at once. A lady was seated near,
reading. The place in which this happened was
an enclosed meadow, all green and fresh, with
lovely blue-bells on the banks around.

Among the blue-bells might be seen now and
then a few timid rabbits, showing their soft
brown heads, and lustrous eyes.

Unaware of the dog's presence in the field,
two or three had peeped a few minutes before,
and Watch, seeing them, had scampered to the
mouth of their nest, and attempted to scratch the
surrounding earth away, frightening the poor
little creatures into the farthest corner of their
place of refuge, thereby gaining the reproof
already mentioned.

"We must go home, Sunshine," said the
lady.

"Must we, mamma?"
!!!!! 011.txt !!!!!

"Yes, dear; I have business to attend to
there."

Sunshine was disappointed. She wanted very
much to remain longer; and no wonder, for it
was not much past four o'clock in the day, and
one of the brightest summer days that could be
imagined. The air was soft and warm, the
grass dry enough to sit upon, the wild flowers
plentiful and sweet, the birds in full song, her
favourite dog at her side ready for any romp,
and an attractive picture book in her pocket.
But Sunshine neither cried nor pouted, although
she was disappointed. She did not even say
"Oh, I am so sorry." No; she put her tiny
hand in that of her mamma, and with the words,
"Come, Watch," they walked together across
the meadow, pressing down the carpet of grass
and daisies with their feet as they went:
climbed a fence, walked through two other
meadows, passed through an iron gate, and
entered their own kitchen garden.

The little girl's name was Florence Ross, but
!!!!! 012.txt !!!!!
her parents had given her the pet name, "Sunshine,"
because she was so loving and good
tempered, and helped to make happiness at
home.

At length they reached the house. It was
large and pleasant, with windows to the ground,
opening upon the lawn. Mrs. Ross and Florrie
entered at one of these, and the child went to
her bed-room, to remove her walking dress.
Such a pretty room it was--a bright, clean
paper was upon the walls, very white curtains
and counterpane graced the little bed, muslin
curtains were inside the window, and outside,
dark, glossy ivy leaves, just peeping round the
frames, as though they would say, "Good
morning, Sunshine!" when the blue eyes opened--or
"Good night" when the moon's rays
showed them to the little one, after she was
tucked up in bed. Over the mantlepiece was
an illuminated card, bearing the words, "He
shall gather the lambs with His arm, and carry
them in His bosom." This was the work of
!!!!! 013.txt !!!!!
Mrs. Ross, and as she hung it there, she prayed
earnestly that her Florrie might follow the
loving Shepherd, who cares thus tenderly for
His lambs, and that she might never wander
from His safe and happy fold.

As we become better acquainted with Florrie's
daily life, we shall be able to judge if these
prayers were answered, for "even a child is
known by his doings."

Those lovely summer days gave place to
autumn's richly tinted clouds, and wealth of
fruit. Then the earth was arrayed in her
dazzling dress of snow, and next the tiny shoots
appeared, and the snowdrops began to peep up
from the ground. A little higher, and a little
higher still, and at last the delicate blossom
formed itself into the graceful bell-shaped
flower.

One day at this season, Mrs. Ross and
Florrie visited Covent Garden market, and
returned by train, for their home was several
miles from London. Florrie had admired a
!!!!! 014.txt !!!!!
little pot of snowdrops there very much, they
were unusually fine, and Mrs. Ross had bought
them for her.

As they sat together in the railway carriage,
Florrie watched them closely, for she feared
their pretty heads would break and fall off,
from the motion of the train; however, they did
not, and the little girl carried them to her
home in safety.

"Where shall I put them, mamma?" asked
she, as she trotted along the road at her
mamma's side.

"In your own little garden, my dear. Ask
Murphy to plant them for you."

Before Florrie entered her home, she ran to
the gardener, exclaiming, "Look, Murphy, are
not these pretty? Will you please dig a place
for them?"

"Yes, yes, Miss Florence, deary; to be sure
Murphy will put them in for you."

"Are they not beautifully white, Murphy?"

"Oh lovely, Missie; they are, indeed!"
!!!!! 015.txt !!!!!

"I think they must be very good flowers,
don't you?"

"Good, good?" repeated the old man,
enquiringly.

"Yes, good,--not naughty, you know.
Mamma tells me about people being pure, and she
says only those who are made pure can go to
heaven to live with God, His dear Son Jesus,
and the holy angels."

"Ah, Missie, I should like to be pure at my
heart like they snowdrops. You are nearer to
that, little dear, than Murphy is."

There was not time for the gardener and
child to arrive at a clear understanding of the
truth just then, for Sunshine was called into
the house.

If Mrs. Ross had overheard the conversation,
she would probably have said, "There is none
that doeth good, no not one." There is but one
way to heaven--"Christ is the way, the truth,
and the life." We have no real purity, except
that which is gained by washing our robes and
!!!!! 016.txt !!!!!

making them white in the blood of the Lamb.
It is the Lamb of God, and He alone, "who
taketh away the sin of the world."

Murphy took the greatest care of Sunshine's
snowdrops, and when their pale heads drooped
and died, he found other sweet flowers to take
their place; and told his little favourite, that if
the bulbs remained, they would throw out new
leaves and blossoms in the following spring.

And in the old man's heart remained the
impression made by the child's words about
purity, to be hidden for a time, like the bulbs,
and, like them, to bud and blossom in future
days.

The pretty laburnum drooped its graceful
golden flowers,--the sweetly scented lilac burst
forth,--the June roses came and went, giving
place to other lovely flowers and rich fruits.

And Sunshine, in her large cotton hat, watered
and weeded. She spent a great deal of time in
her garden. She had neither brother nor
sister. Her principal play-fellow was "Watch."
!!!!! 017.txt !!!!!
She enjoyed a chat with Murphy, too, and the
honest hearted man loved to listen to her
childish talk. He would walk miles to procure
a rare flower, or anything else he thought likely
to please her.
!!!!! 018.txt !!!!!

Chapter II.

RESCUED.

So the happy days passed on,
until one evening near the
end of summer, Mr. and Mrs.
Ross were walking with
Florrie in a meadow, near
their garden.

In this meadow was a pond, over which a
beautiful willow tree grew.

The moon was shining brightly, and the
willow reflected itself in the water beneath. The
effect of this reflection was so pretty, that the
two stopped to admire, and Mr. Ross said, if one
!!!!! 019.txt !!!!!
had but a magic pencil to catch that, just as we
see it now, the picture would be valuable.

On the next morning, Florrie, not staying to
think that the same strong reflection would not
be visible in broad day-light, marched to the
pond with her drawing pencils and paper, intending
to astonish her papa by her pourtrayal of the
willow in the water.

"Murphy, I will tell you a secret," she said,
as she passed through the garden. "Papa and
mamma were admiring that beautiful willow"
over the pond last night, and I have very good
pencils--new ones--and a new sheet of drawing
paper, and I am going to try and sketch the
pond and the tree, and save my money, and
have it framed, to give to papa on his birthday.
Will it not surprise him, if I can do it?
You will be sure and not tell, Murphy."

"I won't tell, Missie, depend upon it," and
Murphy discontinued his digging operations to
watch the little feet patter along the garden
path. The bright curls danced in the sun's rays,
!!!!! 020.txt !!!!!
and the laughing face turned round to say,
"Good bye, don't tell."

The garden gate closed behind the child.
Watch whined because he was chained up, and
could not follow her.

"You shall come with me when I have finished
my picture, Watch," said the sweet little voice;
then, bounding across the field, the child sang
one of her nursery songs, and Murphy resumed
his work.

For some moments he heard the clear tones
of Florrie's voice singing--then it ceased, and
in less than a minute a splash could be heard
in the water. Murphy dropped his spade and
looked towards the pond.

The child's sun hat was floating upon the
water, she herself nowhere visible.

In a moment he sprang over the flower beds,
heedless of the havoc he was making amongst
his own carefully finished work.

"Watch!" he cried. Out sprang the dog--the
collar was removed from his neck in an instant.
!!!!! 021.txt !!!!!

"Bring her out, good dog;" and man and dog
sprang through the meadow. As they neared
the pond, the child's head appeared above the
water, and her arms were thrown upwards.

"Quick, good dog, bring her out!" shouted
Murphy, as he ran. The dog was first at the
pond, and the sagacious creature darted immediately
at the drowning Florrie--seized her
dress, and began to pull toward the bank. Sunshine
and Watch were struggling for dear life
now, and bravely the dog kept his hold, until
Murphy walked into the pond, and with the
water above his waist lifted the little trembling
one in his arms, and waded out with her,
followed closely by the faithful dog.

"Don't go and frighten the mistress to death,
cook," exclaimed Murphy, as he entered the
kitchen, with his little favourite in his arms,
now all pale and unconscious.

Murphy forgot that he was alarming poor
cook rather seriously, by the sudden appearance
of the saturated and deathly-looking child.
!!!!! 022.txt !!!!!
But cook was a sensible woman, and in less
than five minutes Mrs. Ross was on the spot,
and the best restoratives were being used.

After consciousness returned, Florrie lay
still in her bed for hours, with her hand in
that of her mother, who sat beside her. But
once she said, "Bring Watch, please mamma."
Watch was called, and she put her arm around
his neck, and told him that he was a dear, good,
beautiful dog.

"And I saw you jump into the water to save
me, you dear old Watch," she repeated. The
dog's brown eyes, so full of intelligence, seemed
to reply lovingly to each word. He licked her
hand and whined with delight; then turned to
Mrs. Ross, and capered about her most joyously,
as though he would say, "How glad we are
that she is alive."

But after this admission to the house and to
the room of his little mistress, Watch became
importunate for a place beside the child constantly.
He was a yard dog. And cook had
!!!!! 023.txt !!!!!
"MURPHY WALKED INTO THE POND..................AND WADED OCT
WITH HER."
!!!!! 024.txt !!!!!
[Blank Page]
!!!!! 025.txt !!!!!
many times informed him that she would not
have his dirty feet marks all over her kitchen
floor, and he was just to go out to his proper
place, and be fastened up. At such times
Watch had been in the habit of looking demure,
and walking out of the house. But now times
were changed, he would whine upon the kitchen
door-step, until the cook let him in, and if the
whine proved ineffectual he would howl, and
scratch at the door. Once inside the kitchen,
he would give expression to his gratitude by
barks and leaps, which endangered the dinner-service
upon the dresser; then make his way
to the next closed door, and whine again, nor
cease until he could lie down by the side of his
little mistress.

In a couple of days, Murphy was delighted
to find that Florrie had so far recovered as to
be able to take a turn in the garden, seated in
an invalid chair.

How proud the good man looked as he guided
the chair! And Watch, marching beside it,
!!!!! 026.txt !!!!!
seemed no less proud. The dog's noble head
was erect, and quite on the alert to catch the
words addressed to him by Florrie.

"Good Watch! Beautiful Watch!" she said
often. "I love you, good dog!" And the dog's
speaking eyes gave sufficient answer.

"I will go in now, if you please, Murphy,"
said the child at length.

Murphy carried her into the library, where
sat Mr. Ross.

"Sit down for a minute or two, Murphy; I
want to speak to you," said the gentleman, as
he placed Florrie in an easy chair; then rang
the bell for a servant to ask Mrs. Ross if she
would join them. Mrs. Ross came, and as she
seated herself near the child, Mr. Ross said,
"We cannot repay you, Murphy, for saving the
life of our child. Neither can I say much about
it. My gratitude is too deep for many words.
You have been, and are still, a faithful servant,
and as a mark of our appreciation of your daily
services, and our thankfulness to you, and for
!!!!! 027.txt !!!!!
this great and special service, will you accept
from Mrs. Ross this Bank note, and from myself
a cottage rent free for your life time?

Murphy took the note in his hand, and gazed
at it with astonishment. Ten pounds! He had
never before in his life owned so much money.
Then laying it upon the table, he said with
much feeling,--

"I did not get Missie out of the pond for
that, Sir."

Of course he did not. Poor, honest Murphy!
Mr. and Mrs. Ross well knew that he did not,
and kindly they impressed this upon his mind;
then sent him home with a basket of nice
provisions, that his wife and he might enjoy
them together, and the Bank note was enclosed
in a large envelope, and pinned to his waistcoat
pocket by the cook before he started with it.
!!!!! 028.txt !!!!!

CHAPTER III.

"The pure in heart."

The next day was Sunday,
and the rescued child was
able to walk to the house of
God with her parents.

"I will pay my vows unto the
Lord, now in the presence of all
His people," said Mrs. Ross, softly,
to her husband, as they entered. Her eyes
were full of tears. And she held the little
one's hand firmly, as she spoke. Mr. Ross
well understood her meaning. And two full
!!!!! 029.txt !!!!!
hearts poured out their thankfulness before the
great loving Father in Heaven, for sparing
their beloved child.

Many, many times in the few days that had
elapsed since Florrie's accident, they had
thanked God for His mercy; but into His
courts they felt they must go to-day with
special thanksgiving and praise.

And the little Florrie thanked God, too, for
His great goodness to her.

Moreover, she listened attentively to the
sermon. The text was, "Blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God."--(Matt. v. 8.)

The preacher began at the end of his text.
He spoke of God, His perfect purity, and
hatred of sin; His unwavering justice, and so
on, quoting the words:--

"Eternal Light! Eternal Light!
How pure the soul must be,
When placed within Thy searching sight,
It shrinks not, but with calm delight
Can live and look on Thee."
!!!!! 030.txt !!!!!

Then the "pure in heart," those who shall
see God, were described.

"These are they," said the preacher, "who,
feeling their own weakness, and unrighteousness
before God, have gone to Him, and
earnestly cried for 'a clean heart,' and 'a right
spirit,' and who now can truthfully say,

'Jesus, Thy Blood and Righteousness
My beauty are, my glorious dress.'

"And for these," he continued, "there is
no condemnation; they shall see His face, and
His name shall be in their foreheads. They
shall walk for ever in the light of the beautiful
home, where dwell the Lord God and the Lamb.

"Truly blessed then, are such! for they
'have right to the tree of life,' and shall enter
in through the gates into the city."

The congregation then sang:--

"Oh for the robes of whiteness!
Oh for the tearless eyes!
Oh for the glorious brightness
Of the unclouded skies!
!!!!! 031.txt !!!!!

"Oil for the no more weeping,
Within the land of love!
The glorious rest of keeping,
The Bridal feast above.

"Oh for the bliss of rising
My risen Lord to meet!
Oh for the rest of lying
For ever at His feet!

"Oh for the hour of seeing
My Saviour face to face!
The hope of ever being
In that sweet meeting place."

The sermon was not lost upon Florrie, for on
the following day she repeated a good part of
it most correctly to Murphy, as she trotted
about the garden by his side, while he paid
the utmost attention to all she talked about;
and when he reached his home that night he
said to his wife--"The little one has been talking
to me about the sermon she heard yesterday;
her memory is wonderful, surely. Bless
her heart! If anybody can teach Murphy the
!!!!! 032.txt !!!!!
way to heaven, she can. I shall go to church
next Sunday, Missus, if I am spared. Will you
go too? God has blessed us wonderful, I
consider; and we are worse than two black
heathens to sit here Sunday after Sunday, as
we do. I am downright ashamed of myself; I
don't know how you feel about it."

"I call that 'turning over a fresh leaf,'"
responded Mrs. Murphy, as she drew up the
weights of the clock, and set the alarum to
awaken them at five in the morning.

Shortly after this, letters arrived, bringing to
Mrs. Ross news of the death of an elder brother,
who had been living some years in America. He
had been in possession of a large estate there,
and having died without wife or family, had
left the property to his brother's only child, our
little Florrie. It was needful that Mr. Ross
should be on the spot to ensure and guard it
for her. Accordingly the family departed for
America, much to the grief of poor Murphy.
Still his cottage could not be taken from him,
!!!!! 033.txt !!!!!
and Mr. Ross left him with the promise, that
should he write and tell him that he was ill, or
out of work, money should be forwarded to
him immediately. "God bless you, Murphy,"
were his last words to the old servant. "You
shall never want a friend while I live. Let me
know by the very quickest means, if you are
in need of any kind. Never mind the expense
of those means. I will defray all expenses,
and send you money at once. But, bye the
bye," he continued, "I fear you may find difficulties
in this plan. It will take some time for
you to get an answer from New York. I will
leave you in charge of the Rev.------ -------, go
to him if you need anything. I will make all
arrangements with him, concerning you."

"Dear Murphy!" said little Sunshine, as
she placed her tiny hand in the gardener's hard
palm; "dear Murphy, I shall often write you
a nice long letter. And I don't believe we
shall have such a nice gardener in America.
And if he is as kind as you, I do not think I
!!!!! 034.txt !!!!!
shall ever like him half a quarter as well as I
like you."

The old man wept. And Watch, after studying
his face for a few seconds, drew close to
him, and licked the hand that rested on his
knee. Doggie like, true to his faithful race, he
sympathized with his troubled friend.

On the next day the steamer started, and
after many a tearful adieu, Mr. and Mrs. Ross,
Florrie, and Watch, left England.
!!!!! 035.txt !!!!!

Chapter IV.

THE OLD MAN LEARNS TO READ.

Four years passed away, and
Mr. Ross having business in
England, visited it again.

Murphy wrote occasionally
during that time; but had
never asked for help of any kind
from his old master, or from the gentleman
who had undertaken to act for him in case of
need.

"I will go and see Murphy first," thought
Mr. Ross, as he landed; and as soon as the
!!!!! 036.txt !!!!!
train could take him to Murphy's cottage, he
went.

It was an evening in early spring. The
weather was cold. As he drew near the cottage,
he perceived the shutters were unclosed;
and a bright fire burned in the grate.

By the fireside was Murphy, beside him sat a
little girl, pointing with her finger to a page of
an open book, which lay upon the table.
Evidently the child was teaching the old man
to read. And Mrs. Murphy had ceased knitting,
to gaze at the pair over the top of her
spectacles.

On the table were two little flower-pots, each
containing lovely snowdrops. A gentle tap at
the door, and candle in hand, Mrs. Murphy
stood face to face with the stranger.

"Peter Murphy, look you here!" she
exclaimed, with a start, and without further
explanation, sat down in the nearest chair and
cried for joy; while Murphy, quite as delighted,
but less demonstrative, led in his guest in
!!!!! 037.txt !!!!!
triumph, and seated him beside the fire. "Now
Missis, come, come!" exclaimed he, "cry after
you have made the kettle boil, and got the
master some tea."

Thus admonished, Mrs. Murphy put on the
tea kettle, and mounted a chair, to reach from
her corner cupboard her china cups and glass
sugar basin.

With many apologies, a nice tea was served
up in a short time.

"Please to move the Bible and the flowers,
Peter," said the wife, as she held the tea tray
in her hands, ready to place it before Mr. Ross.

"The Bible and flowers," repeated Murphy,
as he carefully placed them on a side table.

"What fine snowdrops!" exclaimed Mr. Ross.

"They ought to be fine, sir," returned the
old man; "if ever flowers were watched over
they are."

"Are they such great favourites then?"

"Five springs back, sir," continued Murphy,
"I was just living for this world; I tried to be
!!!!! 038.txt !!!!!
honest, and to do my duty, to be sure. But I
had a notion that my honesty, and all the rest
of my goodness, would take me to heaven; and
yet I felt very uncomfortable about it, too, at
times; for I knew I was far enough from being
perfect, and I did not see the way to make
myself perfect either. And it was just through
these snowdrops I got my first lesson in the
right way, at least, it was from snowdrops that
sprang from them very bulbs."

"How so?" asked Mr. Ross.

"Dear Miss Florrie came to me in the
garden one day, with a little pot of snowdrops;
and she said:--'I think they must be very
good flowers, don't you?' And when I asked
her meaning, and I remember every word as
if it was but yesterday, she answered:--'Yes,
good, not naughty. Mamma tells me about
people being pure; and she says only those
who are made pure can go to heaven, to live
with God and His dear Son Jesus, and the
holy angels.'
!!!!! 039.txt !!!!!

"I thought and thought over these words,
until I felt quite sure I was not pure and good
enough to find a blessed home in that beautiful
place; and I got no rest, till I found out that
'the blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, cleanseth
from all sin'; and I asked God, with all my
heart, to cleanse me from sin for Christ's sake.
Then I got no rest till my missus thought as I
did, and now, in my old days, I am trying to
learn the Bible. This little girl lives next door,
and she comes in of an evening to teach me.
And, thank God, we love the Bible, my missus
and I. And we both watch the snowdrops, as
though they were our children. And we are
looking for a blessed home yonder, sir, for ever
and ever, when our work is done here."

Murphy ceased speaking, and looked into the
fire. The little girl had fallen asleep--and as
Mrs. Murphy removed the tea tray, she asked,
"How is Watch, sir?"

"Quite well, and noble as ever," was the
reply.
!!!!! 040.txt !!!!!

"And the dear Mistress and Miss Florrie are
well, sir, you say?"

"Yes, both well and happy. And I have a
message from them to you. God has in His
wisdom increased our riches considerably; and
they unite with me in the request that you will
both return with me to America, and inhabit a
home there instead of here, on the same terms.
And that you, Murphy, will become my daughter's
attendant, a sort of guard in her walks, &amp;c.
The remuneration for this service will be enough
to keep yourself and wife in comfort. And we
shall have the satisfaction of seeing that you
are well cared for as long as you live. Do you
feel disposed to fall in with this plan?"

The couple looked at each other; they had
no living child, or tie of any kind, for their only
child was dead; still they loved their native
land.

The wife was first to speak--

"Will you go, master?"

"Yes, if you will, wife."
!!!!! 041.txt !!!!!

"I took you for 'better or worse' many a
long year ago, and I won't part from you now.
Nor I couldn't refuse, when the master asks us
so kindly. So we'll go," returned the quivering
voice.

In a few weeks from this time, Mrs. Ross
and Florence, still called Sunshine, with Watch
by their side, stood telescope in hand, by the
side of New York bay, anxiously looking for a
steamer. It came, and on board were Mr.
Ross, Murphy, Mrs. Murphy, the Bible, and
the Snowdrops.
!!!!! 042.txt !!!!!

Chapter V.

MISTHER BARNEY MCCRANKUM.

With the same bright face and
footstep as light as in earlier
years, Florrie hastened to
meet the party when they
landed. Altogether heedless
of bystanders or etiquette,
she threw her arms about her papa's neck, as a
wee child might have done in the same circumstances.

A sweet loving creature she looked truly,
with her heightened colour, bright eyes, and
beautiful expression.  The closely following
!!!!! 043.txt !!!!!
Watch was even more demonstrative than his
young mistress; he sprang and capered--barked
and sprang again, at the sight of his master;
while Mrs. Ross quietly came up, placed her
hand in that of her husband; and repeated the
welcome in a suppressed and quivering voice.
Her manner and tones reminded Mr. Ross of the
day when she said, as she entered the house of
God--"I will pay my vows unto the Lord, now
in the presence of all His people," the Sunday
after Florrie's rescue from the pond. They
expressed similar deep thankfulness, gladness
and love, as then tears were appearing, in
spite of her efforts to keep them back. And as
she turned to Murphy and his wife, and heard
their heartfelt "God bless you, Ma'am!" the
tears, would, and did come.

Next Florrie greeted the old servants right
joyously, and Watch did the same. If any one
imagines that the dog had forgotten his friends
in the space of four years, it is a mistake; he
would have recognised Murphy as readily as
!!!!! 044.txt !!!!!
Murphy would have recognized him, if they had
happened to meet at Cape Horn, or among the
rocky mountains. Accordingly he capered and
barked to his heart's content, and no one had
the will to check his demonstrations of joy.
So they formed rather a noisy party, until they
reached the carriage that was waiting to convey
them home. In it were a pair of horses, one
of them, very high spirited. As the party took
their seats and started, Watch, in the excess of
his joy, jumped barking around the heads of
the horses. A most unusual course this for the
sagacious, middle-aged Watch to pursue. So
thought the coachman, for he exclaimed with
strong Irish accent--

"Arrah, darlint dog, are ye moonstruck this
bright day? Be aisy now, can't ye."

But the head of the more spirited horse was
tossed back in a moment; his fore-feet lifted
high, and with great force, he tried to free himself
from all restraint. It seemed as though the
reins must break, or the driver lose his hold of
!!!!! 045.txt !!!!!
them, under the prancing and powerful movement
of the startled horse.

Not so, however. Misther Barney McCrankum
was used to the excitable nature of "Barney's
boy," as he called the horse.

"Didn't he bring him over from ould Ireland?"
he would ask, if any one disputed his right and
power to govern him. "An' didn't I, sure," he
would add, "didn't I make acquaintance with
the jewel when he was the most beautiful
juvenile, an' looked as though he had come
straight from 'Rabia?' An' didn't the Masther
buy the horse, and hire Misther Barney to
manage him, because it was just the most sensible
thing in the world to do, seein' that the
crathur wouldn't be managed by any other body?
So ye need not volunteer to give good advice
about the best and beautiflest horse in the world.
If Misther Barney can't manage him, no more
can anyone else. There's one thing about it
sure. Yer whip and yer grand batings wouldn't
do for 'Barney's boy'; that's supposin' you
!!!!! 046.txt !!!!!
or your friends had any respect for yer
safety."

Barney did not try the whip in the present
emergency, hut held the reins firmly, and spoke
soothingly to the animal. Presently the two
fore-feet were brought down to the ground.
The horse champed his bit, and tossed his head,
but made no further sign of perturbation.

Barney descended from his elevation to finish
his soothing work, and adjust the harness;
while Mr. Ross, from the carriage window, called
Watch to order. "Shall I fix it?" exclaimed a
sprightly American boy, as he darted from one of
the stores. But Barney told the boy that the
"crathur" wouldn't let anybody touch him just
now, "save an' except his Masther," adding,
almost in the same breath, to Watch--

"It's very ungintlemanly of ye, to go for to
scare the horses, and break ivery bone of the
quality, Misther Barney's bones too."

The American boy laughed, and looked on.
There were other lookers on by this time.
!!!!! 047.txt !!!!!
Several sharp featured men and boys. A
coloured woman, and a fair, blue-eyed girl, who
made several comments on the scene before her,
to the dark woman. They were strangers to
each other evidently, for neither one could
understand a word said by the other. No
wonder. The girl had come from Germany
about a month previous to that time. She had
learned a few English words, but pronounced
them imperfectly, and used them in wrong
places; altogether producing a medley, which
must have proved unintelligible to her own
countrymen, but was amusing to the occupants
of the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Ross both
happening to be German scholars.

Watch looked reproved by Barney's words,
and retreated to the back of the carriage. And
Barney patted the neck of the frightened horse,
saying as he did so,

"Who's for to hurt ye, me honey? Be aisy
now. It's yer masther, me jewel."

The beautiful creature curved his neck, and
!!!!! 048.txt !!!!!
fixed his eyes upon Barney's face. A casual
observer would probably have thought that the
horse was perfectly quiet now. But Barney
observed that the veins about his head were
still swollen, and his eyes looked large and
fierce in their expression. So with all the
kindness of a warm-hearted man, who knew, well
the nature of the animal he professed to govern
and tend, Barney stood for some minutes
soothing and encouraging the poor beast, knowing
that he had suffered intensely from fear.

The untaught Barney had a big heart and
some common sense; and it seemed to him that
it was better to decrease the fear by soothing,
than to increase it by shameful and cowardly
whipping.

Barney had been known to alight, after
'Barney's boy' had shied at a piece of paper,
or a puddle in the road, and, with all the gentleness
of a woman, lead the horse firmly up to
the startling object, saying to the poor, scared
thing, in tones it well understood:--*
!!!!! 049.txt !!!!!

*"Sure, honey, 'tis nothing to fright ye, just
a bit o' paper, nothing more at all."

Some persons laughed at Barney's coaxing
plan. But one thing is certain; the Merciful
Maker of all living creatures laughs NOT at
oppression and injustice. All the beasts of the
forest are HIS. Every strong willing limb and
muscle are the work of HIS mighty hand.

They are ours to use, certainly. But with
the possession and use comes a responsibility--that
of using them aright. Neither does our
responsibility end here concerning them. Men
and women who walk the public streets, and
must daily witness, or run away from sickening
instances of neglect and cruelty towards animals,
are responsible for their individual effort to
suppress the cowardly sin. The children are
responsible, too, in this matter to a great extent.
For instance, the little girl who has a donkey
ride at a Sunday School treat, or elsewhere,
can, if she will, prevent the donkey's master
from beating him with a thick stick, as he trots
!!!!! 050.txt !!!!!
quickly along. At least quickly for a donkey
that has not improbably been trotting best part
of the day, after a poor breakfast, a poor stable,
and a poor bed. It is highly amusing for a boy
to set a cat flying in terror, but the boy who
scares cats, &amp;c., will probably do something
more cowardly still, as years pass on, and perhaps
something more cruel.

"Misther Barney McCrankum" never did
have a taste for this manly sport, or possibly
the attempt to train "Barney's boy" would
have proved a failure.

The occupants of the carriage patiently
waited until Barney had restored order, and
"settled," as he said, the horse that seemed to
be the very pride of his heart. Then they
started again, and soon reached their New York
home in safety.

Chapter VI.

BARNEY REFLECTS.

MR. and Mrs. Murphy wondered
as they went, that the
streets should look so like
London streets, and that
the people were so much like
the people of old England.
The greatest difference they observed was, that
the features of many were sharper, and their
manner exceedingly quick and independent.

The well stocked stores, and smart store
keepers, the innumerable vehicles, and stylishly
dressed ladies, all helped to increase their aston-*
!!!!! 052.txt !!!!!
*ishment. Evidently they had expected to find
the Americans in about the same stage of civilization
as the ancient Britons were, when Julius
Cæsar landed on the island. Murphy arrived
at the conclusion, that the backwood kind of life
he had heard about, from a man who had lived
in the backwoods of 'Meriky,' had not got so
far as New York.

Mrs. Murphy summed up by saying: "backwoods
a'int New York, and New York a'int
backwoods," a fact to which Murphy assented.
The simple-hearted couple would probably have
got a sharper explanation than was due to them
if a New Yorker had been within hearing.
However none were about them just then, and
Mrs. Murphy continued,--

"Well, I am astonished! I thought it would
be all a wild wilderness!"

"You had faith in us, then," said Mrs. Ross,
kindly; "or you would never have ventured to
come to us in such a place as you imagined it to
be."
!!!!! 053.txt !!!!!

"Well, ma'am," was Murphy's reply, the
master said he would never forsake us. And
we never did have anything but real truth from
you and the master. So we never thought of
doubting his word. Besides, we shall be happier--a
sight happier, near you. We don't forget
Miss Florrie, ma'am, not we, nor what she has
done for us."

"Been the means, through God, of doing,"
suggested Mr. Ross.

"Yes, Sir, true. The means, through God, of
doing for us. And we love her, my missis an'
me. We love her so much that we left our own
pretty lass in her grave over yonder at home, to
come to her and you, and the mistress."

Florrie, in a corner of the carriage, wondered
what she had ever done for Murphy and his
wife, to merit so much gratitude. And Mr.
Ross said--

"Have you made arrangements with any one
to keep your child's grave in order?"

"Well no, Sir; the day before we started I
!!!!! 054.txt !!!!!
went and turfed it afresh, planted some flowers,
and made a good twig covering for it. And my
Missis cleaned the head stone. So it is all
right for the present."

"I will have it properly attended to in
future," returned Mr. Ross.

As he spoke the thought occurred to him, that
had not Murphy interposed, his own bright
Florrie might have been lying far away in old
England--or rather the body of that loving child
might have been mingling with the dust there.

Little more was said upon the subject just
then; but Mr. and Mrs. Murphy were appreciated,
and treated as their age and faithfulness
merited.

It was pleasant to see their surprise and
delight at the neat, pretty home provided for
them, in close proximity to Mr. Ross's house, and
most amusing to listen to Murphy's remarks, when
he found they had scarcely anything to do, except
to rejoice together over their peace and plenty.

He never came with the intention of being a
!!!!! 055.txt !!!!!
gentleman, he said, but a servant. Mr. Ross
only smiled, and told him he was a gentleman
in the highest sense of the word, and he must
submit to be treated accordingly. Certainly, he
attended Florrie in her walks, but that was the
extent of his labour.

Florrie had a habit of turning out of the hand
some streets of the city into places where the
miserably destitute could be found. At such
times Murphy was a treasure, for he protected
her from insult, and carried provisions for her to
distribute at the same time.

Often, too, for his own pleasure he mounted
the coach-box beside Barney, and took upon him
self the office of opening the carriage door; at
such times he never failed to converse with
Barney about the beautiful old country; and
Barney in return spoke the praises of his ould
Ireland.

And often the old man ventured to speak of
a land more beautiful than either--and of the
way to reach it.
!!!!! 056.txt !!!!!

The well-loved household truth concerning
Florrie and the Snowdrops was repeated.
Barney's warm heart grew warmer as he heard
it, for he loved his young mistress, partly because
she was sweet tempered, and partly
because she was very considerate about his
horses.

"My father and mother are good Catholics,
ye see," Barney said one day as he held the
reins, and Murphy sat beside him. Murphy
had just referred him to a passage of Scripture
that he felt would give weight to some remark
made by himself.

"My parents are good Catholics, ye see; and
we do not read the Bible."

"Humph," was Murphy's reply; then he
continued--

"Will you oblige me by calling in at my
cottage to have a little more talk about this,
Mr. McCrankum?"

"An' I'll be proud and happy, Misther
Murphy, to do the same. Me taste don't lie in
!!!!! 057.txt !!!!!
the direction of New York evening amusements.
I'll be glad enough, sure, to sit by your fireside
for half an hour when the work's done. An' it
'll remind me o' the days when I sat beside me
father's fire, an' heard him tell o' miracles an'
wonders. An' my mother would bless you,
sure, if she knew that you took the smallest bit
o' interest in her boy Barney. She's got a
strange consate about her Barney. It nearly
went for to break her heart when the steamer
started with the 'boy' an' me. An' yet it was
for me good, she knew. Sure, an' I knew that
well enough meself too. But for all that, me
heart aches when I sit and think o' me mother
an' father, left behind in the beautiful ould
counthry. An' I'm afther thinkin' that I'll save
the money and send for them. It's hard enough
there for them. Sure, the dear place itself is
green enough, an' the soil is rich enough.
There is plenty in the land to feed the rich an'
poor. But somehow it is, the poor can't all
live there. It's pinin' work for the crathurs."
!!!!! 058.txt !!!!!

"Too many people, too many people," returned
Murphy. "Send for them as soon as you
can save the money; if you think your father
can get work."

"Me father's not an old man, ye see. I'm
the biggest boy. An' little Norah, the jewel,
is a baby, wi' yellow hair, an' sky-blue eyes.
An' there's seven more: that's nine brothers an'
sisters, ye see. But this is a big counthry.
There's lots o' room for them in it."

"True," returned Murphy. "You be sure
and look in for an hour to-night. Then we can
talk over this matter, as well as the other."

In the evening Barney called upon his friend,
according to arrangement. A couple of hours
passed pleasantly away. And after he had
departed, Mrs. Murphy remarked "that she
liked the young man's 'pearance," adding, "it
will be as well if you ask him to come in
often, master. It's rather trying for a young
man to have no friends but his master and
mistress, in a place like this." Mrs. Murphy
!!!!! 059.txt !!!!!
never had cause to regret that she had made
this suggestion. And Barney was exceedingly
grateful, when he perceived that she was bent
upon being a sort of second mother to him.
She mended his stockings, hemmed his handkerchiefs,
and did everything else in that way,
which tended to make him more comfortable.

Barney visited the cottage every evening, and
before he left Murphy would read a chapter in
the Bible. Slowly and carefully the old man
would pronounce each word. The long words
he had to spell, and Barney, being the better
scholar of the two, would help him. At first he
acknowledged that reading the Bible was "a
thrifle against his conscience, sure. Still he
would be 'proud an' happy' if he could 'help
Misther Murphy out wi' it.'" And while he
was helping "Mr. Murphy out," as he said, he
was pondering over some of the passages of
Scripture that by this means came under his
notice. One evening after the reading, he sat
looking hard at the red coals in the grate.
!!!!! 060.txt !!!!!

Presently he exclaimed--

"The Bible says things plain an' straight
enough to me head! An' didn't you just be
readin' 'Search the Scriptures'?"

"Yes, to be sure I did," was the reply.
"That's our Saviour's own command."

"Plain enough," returned Barney. "An'
did the blessed Saviour say that to the people
or to the prastes now?"

"To the people."

Barney began to muse again. Then suddenly
said--

"An' the Bible tells plain enough about the
love He had in His heart to the poor sick
people, an' to St. Peter and St. John, an' the
rest of the disciples."

"Oh yes, it's all plain," replied Murphy.

"An' sure, I used to think the Bible was
much harder to understand, Misther Murphy.
An' I left the understandin' of it to my betters,
as I was told."

"Read it for yourself, my boy; that's God's
!!!!! 061.txt !!!!!
will, and the plain command of Jesus Christ our
Saviour."

"Thrue enough." And Barney rose to go
home. His "God bless ye both," was spoken
very fervently. And as Murphy closed the
door after him, he turned to his wife and said--"May
God bless him, poor lad, and teach him
the right way to heaven."
!!!!! 062.txt !!!!!

Chapter VII.

THE EFFECT OF BEATING.

With all his natural strength
and cheerfulness, Barney
was not always proof against
sickness, and one day he
had fairly to succumb. It
was useless to try to sit up,
and attend to his duties. As soon as a message
to that effect reached Mr. Ross, he went to him.

"Oh, but sure, sir, an' this is bad," said
Barney. " An' yer honour must go, where ye
told me yesterday. An' don't you think I
!!!!! 063.txt !!!!!
could just dhrive you there, an' then come to
me bed agin?"

"No, no, Barney; I cannot allow such a
thing. You lie still. I will send the doctor to
see you. And I will hire a driver for a few
days, until you recover. Try to forget your
work altogether. And you will soon be well
enough, I trust, to get about again."

"But the boy, sir!" said Barney in dismay.

Mr. Ross smiled.

"We will take good care of your beautiful
boy, Barney."

"An' it won't be well for yer honour if that
dhriver uses the whip on his back. I'm afther
believin' he'll be safer in the stable till I get
better, sir."

"I will be sure to speak to him particularly
about the horse," were Mr. Ross's last words
to his faithful servant. True to his promise he
did so. He gave directions that the horse
should on no account be whipped, or he would
become restive and perhaps rather dangerous.
!!!!! 064.txt !!!!!
and with the help of the people who had seen
the commencement of the flight, traced the
carriage. He hurried along in the direction
which the horses were said to have taken, until
he espied the wreck in the distance, and some
people gathered around. One offered brandy
to the man, another wiped the foam from the
horses, and threw rugs over them, others shook
their heads at the broken vehicle: Mr. Ross
walked up to the driver: "Is he seriously
hurt?" was the first question.

"He's kinder better than he was five minutes
ago," replied a pale, dark eyed woman. "I
guess he'll, come round soon."

"Wonderful sprig to fall without breaking
any of his bones," said a man, who was holding
the capsized man upon his arm. "Ai'nt you
all right again?" "Oh yes," was the reply.
"I guess I am fixed now. I lost my senses for
a few minutes, I suppose. I can go on now."
And he turned to look at the carriage and
horses. The horses did not seem in a fit state
!!!!! 065.txt !!!!!
"A SUDDEN LEAP.........AND BOTH HORSES WERE INSTANTLY FLYING ALONG."
!!!!! 066.txt !!!!!
all, sure. He's the best horse in New York,
and one o' the han'somest that ever came out
from ould Ireland." So Barney comforted
himself concerning the accident, nor was he
very wrong in his estimate of the noble beast.
!!!!! 067.txt !!!!!

Chapter VIII.

"I'll just go first, and wait for him."

"MRS. MURPHY is not well
to-day," said Florrie, one
morning, after paying a
visit to the cottage.

"What is amiss, my
dear?" asked Mrs. Ross.

"She says she feels very weak, and she looks
so too, mamma. I wish you would go in and
see her, I feel quite concerned about her."

Mrs. Ross went; and as she talked with
Mrs. Murphy, it seemed to her that the aged
!!!!! 068.txt !!!!!
woman was altered much of late. Her step
was feebler, and her hair whiter, but her eyes
were more bright, and her manner sweeter,
and more subdued.

"I do not grieve," she said. "No, not at
all: though I do think I am sinking fast.
Jesus died for me; I believe it with all my
heart. I believed it long ago. And it is all
well. Sometimes I feel a little inclined to wish
that my master could go with me; but, then, I
think again it is wrong. And God's time is the
right time, for all of us. I'll just go first, and
wait for him, if it is God's will."

In a few weeks from this time, Mrs. Murphy
died--died in full realisation of her "peace
with God, through Jesus Christ, our Lord."
Mrs. Ross, Florrie, and Murphy were around
her in her last moments.

"I want to speak, master," she said; and
Murphy raised her in his arms, that she might
speak with less difficulty. "I want Barney,"
she continued with her weak voice. Barney
!!!!! 069.txt !!!!!
was down stairs, anxiously waiting to hear if
the spirit of the kindly woman he had learned
to love as a mother, was passing away. He
came immediately.

"Come here, my poor boy." Barney bent
his head over her, that he might not lose a
word that fell from her lips.

"'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
thou shalt be saved.' The priests can't save
you--only Jesus, only Jesus."

"An' I know it," said Barney, as he bent his
head lower to hide his tears.

A few words of blessing and prayer--a few
more words of trust in the Redeemer, and the
saved soul left its prison-house for the presence
of the Lord.

Bloom on, beautiful snowdrops! Your lesson
of purity is doing its work. Whisper to many
another, that only the "pure in heart" shall
see God. Tell them, again and again, that to
be pure, they must "wash their robes, and
make them white in the blood of the Lamb."
!!!!! 070.txt !!!!!
Tell them of the fair city, where is "a pure
river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding
out of the throne of God and of the
Lamb." (Rev. xxii., 1.) And where "shall in
no wise enter anything that defileth." (Rev.
xxi., 27.) Tell them that this is offered,
"without money, and without price," to "every
one that thirsteth." Tell them that God "waits
to be gracious." And that Jesus wept over
Jerusalem, and said, "If thou hadst known,
even thou, at least in this thy day, the things
which belong to thy peace." And, as we read
in another place, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them
that are sent unto thee, how often would I have
gathered thee, as a hen gathereth her chickens
under her wings, and ye would not!"

Florrie never thought that she had been the
means of influencing two or three persons so
powerfully. But that matters not; it is
recorded. And highly honoured was she, in
the morning of her life, to be used as an instru-*
!!!!! 071.txt !!!!!
*ment of God. In her simple, earnest way, she
daily influenced many others. But we must
confine ourselves at present to the history of
the few already mentioned. Every one of us,
more or less, must influence others, for evil or
good. There is no escape from it. Actions,
words, looks even, most surely do their work.
Daily, hourly, and as long as we live, this must
go on. How shall our influence become good?
"Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his
way? By taking heed thereto, according to
Thy word." (Psalm cxix., 9.) " Blessed are
the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law
of the Lord. Blessed are they that keep His
testimonies, and that seek Him with the whole
heart." (Psalm cxix., 1, 2.)
!!!!! 072.txt !!!!!

Chapter IX.

THE ARRIVAL.

"NOW, me darlint mother, sure
an' I'm glad enough for to
see you!" exclaimed Barney
one day, about twelve
months after the death of
Mrs. Murphy. "And Norah
me sweet jewel! the sight of you makes me
heart jist pit-a-pat, faster than Barney's boy
can trot."

Barney was escorting his mother and sister
through Broadway at this moment. Behind
!!!!! 073.txt !!!!!
them were Mr. McCrankum, senior, and the
remainder of the family; just eleven in the
party altogether, including Barney. The sharp
American boys seemed to have an impression
as they passed that the newly arrived family's
attire was a little peculiar. Certainly it might
have seemed to be so, for Mrs. McCrankum
wore a bright green dress, a scarlet shawl, and
an amber coloured bonnet; Norah wore a blue
dress, green tippet, and mauve velvet hat. Not
in the least did Barney care for the people's
opinion or remarks about his mother. He
knew quite well that under the green dress
and scarlet shawl, beat a heart even more
loving and faithful than his own. Neither did
Norah's mauve velvet hat hide the sweet
expression in the child's blue eyes, or entirely
cover up the flaxen curls her brother admired
so much. There were two other girls in the
family, dressed in similar smart style. Mr.
McCrankum, senior, was not smart. He
carried a trunk, and three umbrellas. The
!!!!! 074.txt !!!!!
boys were not smart either. They carried
trunks, and one carried a parrot in addition to
his trunk.

"Mother! father! darlint Poll!" screamed
the bird from her uncovered cage.

"Och, Polly, you beauty. Sure an' the bird
has lost none of her consate," said Barney, as
her shrieks reached his ears. "An' how old
do you reckon she is now, mother?"

"Twelve years, to be sure," replied the
mother, with a stronger accent than Barney's.
"Sure enough she was about three whin we
had her first; and that's nine years ago."

Barney looked over his shoulders towards the
bird, and repeated her own words: "Och,
Polly, you beauty!"

"There, take that!" returned she, pecking
vehemently at the wires of her cage. Evidently
Polly was excited and angry. Perhaps she did
not like the fashionable Broadway so well as
the green fields of Erin.
!!!!! 075.txt !!!!!

"Polly, me darlint," persisted Barney.

"Take that, take that!" returned she, striking
her strong beak upon the wires of her cage.

"Arrah! cover the crathur up wi' yer coat
now, Jem," said the father of the family. Jem
obeyed his father's command, and walked the
remainder of the way without a coat, while Polly
from the inside of the cage, tried with a good
deal of energy to peck holes in the lining.

A dutiful son was Barney. He had faithfully
served his master, and carefully saved his
honestly earned money, to bring his family to a
land where at least the young, strong portion
of it might improve their condition, and
where his affectionate nature might enjoy the
society of his parents. Certainly, he had not
saved enough to pay for the passage of the
whole family. But Mr. Ross had sympathized
with him in his project, and materially helped
him. They came in a cheap manner, too. Mr.
Ross had found employment for the father, and
the two sons next to Barney in age, before they
!!!!! 076.txt !!!!!
landed; and there was every chance of the other
elder children obtaining suitable work if needed.
So they were all well cared for in this respect.
But the family required a good sized house to
live in. Barney did not seem to be in the least
troubled about that small item of comfort, however,
for he laughed and chatted as he continued
his walk through Broadway. Evidently he had
some halting place in view. He told them
when he last wrote, that "sure enough, thin," he
would "have a corner ready to put them in,
afther the big sea "had" tumbled "them over.
It is to be hoped that the "corner" would
prove to be large enough for the wearing
apparel, the trunks, and the parrot, in addition
to the numerous members of the family. But
we shall see.

Florence and Murphy began to grow quite
famous for their expeditions together. We have
said they had a habit of turning out of the
fashionable streets of New York sometimes,
and entering the neighbourhoods where poverty
!!!!! 077.txt !!!!!
could be found. Of late this habit had grown
upon them. Habits always strengthen as they
are indulged. However, to this particular one
we heartily wish strength and prosperity. In
New York, in London, and in numberless other
places, the mansions of the rich are very near
to most squalid poverty. Just a handsome square,
it may be, lies between--a crossing, a court,
with a gin palace at the corner, and you are
face to face with misery, and perhaps vice, that
would astonish many a wealthy man and woman
who are not interested in such matters. "Inasmuch
as ye did it not to one of the least of
these, ye did it not to Me." (Matt, xxv., 42, 45.)

But Florence and Murphy are not visitors to
the abode of poverty on the present occasion.
The abode looks exceedingly comfortable. And
they are seated, each in an arm chair, Watch
lying between them. In addition to the two
arm chairs, there are six others, without arms,
a strong table in the middle of the room, and
another under the window, with blooming
!!!!! 078.txt !!!!!
plants upon it. On the principal table is a
white cloth, a large joint of cold meat, a loaf
of bread, some butter, mustard, pepper, salt,
about a dozen cups and saucers, and the same
number of knives and forks. Florence suddenly
rose and walked up to the window.

"Do you see them, Miss Florrie?"

"No, not yet," she returned; then suddenly
exclaimed, as she counted the knives and forks
for the fifth time, "Why, Murphy, there are
not chairs enough in this room for them!"

"I must fetch some more from one of the bed
rooms," replied the old man. Almost before
he had executed this, a tramping of feet was
heard outside, a knock at the door, and Barney
entered with his mother and sister, and on his
lips the words, with a low bow to Florence--

"It's the masther's daughter, mother." Mrs.
McCrankum curtseyed, and Norah did the
same. Florence shook hands with them. And
by this time the rear members of the family
displayed their broad smiling faces.
!!!!! 079.txt !!!!!

"Caw!" shrieked the parrot in her harshest
tones. "Caw! caw!" Watch being disturbed
by the cry, walked up to the cage and tried to
look in.

"Its a bird, honey," said one of the boys as
he removed the covering. "Watch looked deeply
interested, and went closer to the cage.

"Take that! take that!" screamed Polly,
as she attacked the bars again.

"I ask your pardon, Miss Florence," said
Barney, "for the bird's interuptin' you; she's
worried, poor crathur, wi' the journey. And if
I put her on this table wi' the lovely flowers,
she'll be contint."

Barney lifted the cage as he spoke. And
Polly screamed, "caw! caw."

"She is a pretty creature," said Florence;
"how did she learn that cry?"

"Sure an' the crathur learnt it from the
rooks, me leddy," returned Mrs. McCrankum.
"Manys the time, as I've watched her through
the windy, when she's bin out in the sunshine.
!!!!! 080.txt !!!!!
An' the rooks would go over her head, wi' their
caw! caw! An' the crathur would turn up
one of her pretty eyes, an' look after 'em sure.
And whin they'd all gone, she'd cry like 'em.
An' if I tould her not to, she'd jist scream all
the louder, me leddy."

"Oh Polly, what a character!" said Florrie,
as she turned to see if the family were nearly
seated, adding to Murphy, "Will you kindly
dispose of the luggage? Then we shall have
more room. Mrs. McCrankum, will you please
come with your daughters upstairs, and I will
show you your bed rooms?" The out-door
attire was soon removed, and with bright faces
the parents and children took their seats at the
table. Barney carved. Florence and Murphy
went home. And every one of the grateful
McCrankum family declared that "the darlint
young lady was a jewel. An' the touch of her
beautiful hand was like silk; an' if all the
furriners were like her, they were all jewels.
An' sure ivery one of the McCrankum's would
!!!!! 081.txt !!!!!
be ready to run to the world's end for her, the
darlint."

In ignorance of these warm-hearted words of
praise, Florrie walked towards home. But on
her way told Murphy that she should like to
call upon the family she "became acquainted
with yesterday."

"It's a miserable place for you to enter, Miss
Florrie," said the old man. "But if you do not
mind about that, and the master does not object
to your going inside such a place, old Murphy
will not." Together, the old man and the girl,
sat beside an emaciated, poverty-stricken
woman, and together they wept, as she told
them a portion of her misery. She had come
over from England with her husband and their
children. The husband had failed to get employment
for a long time. The children had sickened
through semi-starvation. The husband
took to drinking. The mother worked night
and day at needlework, washing, ironing, anything,
in fact, by which she could earn a little
!!!!! 082.txt !!!!!
money. One child died, then the husband.
Now she herself was ill and half blind, without
means to get advice.

"Oh, Murphy!" exclaimed Florrie, as they
walked home, "how can so many professing
Christians sit down comfortably, and close their
eyes to the wretchdness about their very
doors?"

"And the sin," returned Murphy.

"Yes, the dreadful sin! Do you not think that if
the rich people would visit poor people more, and
show real sympathy towards them, that much of
the sin practised by them could be prevented?"

"Yes, yes, Miss Florrie dear. But before
many of the rich people do that they must teach
themselves to do better. I've heard say that our
own old England is a rich country, very rich;
lots of the people have wonderful fortunes there.
And I think that if all of them had added the
'pearl of great price' to their wealth, there
would be less work for the bankers, and fewer
struggles and trials for another class. It's all
!!!!! 083.txt !!!!!
very well to give a letter for an hospital, but if
any one wants to win the hearts of poor folks,
they should go in and out amongst them; and
not be ashamed to let them see the tears in their
eyes when they are told of sick children, and
many other bitter trials."

"I was too young to know much about the
poverty in England when we left," returned
Florrie, "but mamma has often described it to
me. She says that she thinks it is still greater
in New York, because so many poor things have
managed to get over here cheaply, in the hope
of improving their circumstances, and have not
had means to travel further; while the city itself
has not afforded them suitable employment."

"No doubt it is so," was the reply; "and no
doubt God's blessing will go with every kind
word and action. We can't do great things, in
the way of setting the world to-rights, but we
can do all that lies in our power to relieve the
poor in our own neighbourhood, and to speak
kind words, and make them feel that Christians
!!!!! 084.txt !!!!!
are Christians." Florence smiled, and parted
from Murphy, for she had reached her home.

The old man went to his cottage, blessing the
girl in his heart, while she hastened to her
mother to tell her about the poor woman she
had visited. The struggling mother and her two
remaining children rejoiced that night over a
fire, and a good supper.

On the next day Mrs. Ross and Florrie
visited them together. They had passed through
the worst of their tribulation. Mrs. Ross and
Florrie took care that they should not want any
more. In the gratitude of their hearts, the sick
mother and children rejoiced, and their rejoicing
was better than medicine. They soon grew
well, and the mother gained employment.

CHAPTER X.

BARNEY'S CONTRACT.

"Plase you, ma'am, would the
master be at liberty for me to
spake to him this morning,"
asked Barney, about six
months after the arrival
of his parents, as he presented
himself at the door of the breakfast room.

"Certainly, Barney. Mr. Ross is in the library.
Go to him if you wish to see him."  Barney
went, and after knocking, and gaining admission,
bowed politely, and said he was "anxious to
have the master's advice about a little bit o' a
!!!!! 086.txt !!!!!
conthract he had been an' favoured himself by
entering into."

"Have you been buying some land, Barney?"
asked Mr. Ross.

"Not exactly land, sir. Nor I havn't quite
closed the bargain neither. But it's as bad as
settled. An' I thought I'd jist ask yer honour's
advice." Mr. Ross smiled. It was so comical
of Barney, to "as bad" as settle a matter, and
then come to him for advice about the undertaking.
Barney continued----

"The cook is a fine slip of a girl, sir."

"What did you say?" asked Mr. Ross, bending
his head to catch the words.

"Oh, I beg yer pardon, sir; but I mane that
she's good and han'some."

"Who is good and handsome, Barney?"

"The cook, yer honour." Mr. Ross sat in
mute bewilderment, looking into the face of his
servant for some moments. But getting no
explanation, he asked,

"What ever do you mean, Barney?"
!!!!! 087.txt !!!!!

"It's jist the conthract, yer honour, I want
to spake about." Silence again. At length
Mr. Ross said--

"Are you thinking of being married?"

"That's jist the secret, sir; and I've bought
the ring."

"And our cook is to be your bride, is she?"

"Thrue for yer honour, and a good wife
she'll be."

"I believe it," returned the master, "and
congratulate you both with all my heart. Where
do you intend to live?"

"In the ould place, sir, wi' Mr. Murphy, if
ye don't object."

"No, I am glad it is to be so, for the old
man would be very lonely there by himself.
And your wife will attend to his domestic
affairs, as well as your own, I presume."

"An' she's jist the jewel that will be proud
to be a good daughter to Misther Murphy,
sir."

"I am happy to hear it. And most heartily
!!!!! 088.txt !!!!!
I wish you joy and prosperity. Above all, I pray
that the love of God may dwell in your hearts
through life. Pray for grace that you may 'walk
before the Lord in the land of the living,' watchfully,
faithfully, with a single eye to His glory.
You will need no other blessing."

"Many thanks to you, sir, for yer kind,
beautiful words," returned Barney.

"But kindness does not consist in talking
merely," said Mr. Ross. "I must consult my
wife about some arrangements that will, if
possible, make your wedding day more pleasant.
Of course you will wish to spend it with your
own family?"

"My mother and father would be in grief,
sure, if I didn't. And little Norah's to be a
bridesmaid, and Katey, the next girl, is to be
the other, an' Misther Murphy's to give my
Ellen away to me."

"Capital arrangement so far. But you have
never taken a holiday for any length of time
since you have been with me. I will supply
!!!!! 089.txt !!!!!
you with means, if you will take a wedding
trip for a fortnight."

"But the boy, yer honour! Who's to dhrive
him?"

"Oh," said Mr. Ross laughing, "you had
better take him with you, I think. You and
he are inseparables. But, really, I did not
think of the boy when I spoke. I do not feel
disposed to venture out with him in charge of
a strange driver again. How is it that no one
but yourself can manage him, Barney?"

"Because sure, sir, they don't try. They
jist get in a passion, and bate him when he's
scared at a bit o' paper or a puddle, and think
they'll master him so grand. An' whin they
do, he's sure to fly off, jist mad with fright and
pain. Poor baste! And the touch of his
master's hand, an' jist a word or two from a
voice that he knows, will bring him to at once,
and save the runnin' away, and the breakin' o'
the carriage, and the nate throwin' o' the
coachman into the road, an' the like."
!!!!! 090.txt !!!!!

"I quite agree with you, Barney. And I
think your boy shall be turned into a meadow
to take a holiday also until you return. We
will give both the horses a treat, and do without
the carriage for a fortnight. I am sure Mrs.
Ross will be agreeable. But you know it will
require some pains on your part to bring them
into working order after their rest."

"Oh that's nothing, yer honour, nothing.
But I feel yer kindness intirely. Yer kinder
than I deserve, an' I thank ye wi' my heart."

"When is the wedding day to take place
Barney?"

"Sure, sir, an' Ellen hasn't given notice to
leave to the mistress. An' we thought we'd like
to make it convanient to her. May be the misthress
won't be able to find a cook directly. An'
Ellen won't leave till one comes."

"That is kind of her. Well, we must talk it
over together, and although I am sure Mrs.
Ross will be sorry to lose her cook, she will use
all means in her power to procure another, so
!!!!! 091.txt !!!!!
that your wedding shall not be delayed on her
account."

Barney departed. And the day soon arrived
for "Misther Murphy to give Ellen away to
him."

The carriage was covered up in the coach-house,
and the horses were turned out to
enjoy the green meadow, from morning till night.

There was rejoicing in the McCrankum home,
over the marriage of the eldest son. Kind
words and deeds from the Ross family, and a
happy wedding tour for the bride and bridegroom.
!!!!! 092.txt !!!!!
CHAPTER XI.

"THE ENTRANCE OF THY WORD GIVETH LIGHT."

The "conthract" between
Misther Barney and Ellen
proved to be a good one,
and added materially to the
comfort of Murphy, as
Barney had predicted.

Pleasantly the days passed in the cottage.
The family had but one real care, and that was,
that Mr. and Mrs. McCrankum, senior, blindly
insisted upon avowing that "sure the praste
could give absolution."
!!!!! 093.txt !!!!!

"Mother, me jewel," said Barney, one day,
"the dear Saviour said Himself, to His disciples--not
to the prastes, for they had none--'Search
the Scriptures.' An' I've done it, sure. An'
sat up at night to do the same. An' I can't
find anything in all the New Testament about
the praste giving absolution--listen." Barney
drew a Bible from his pocket as he spoke.

"Away wi' ye, Barney! What would yer father
say, sure, to yer reading the Bible, as can't be
understood by the likes o' you. Sure enough
ye've turned heretic, boy! Away wi' ye now.
An' look at that young Norah listenin' to your
words." Barney glanced at the child, her pretty
eyes were fixed earnestly upon him. Katie, the
girl next in age, was watching and listening too.
A tap at the door. And in less than a minute,
Mrs. McCrankum welcomed Florence and
Murphy.

"I have just called to ask how you are, Mrs.
McCrankum," said Florence.

"We're all well, and thank ye, me leddy.
!!!!! 094.txt !!!!!
An' blessings on yer beautiful face. Katie, two
chairs quick! An' don't be afther standin' still
an' starin,' whin ye ought to be makin' yer
curchey."

In some trepidation, Katie placed two chairs
near Florence and Murphy, and made two
curtseys, not of the most graceful kind. Barney
made a low bow, and said,

"I want me mother to hear a word or two
out of the Bible, Miss Floarance, an' we was jist
a discussin' about it whin ye knocked. Me
mother says it's a sin for ignorant people to read
the beautiful book. An' she says that if we
want pardon, we must confess to the praste, an'
get it." The young Irishman looked imploringly
at Florence, and from her to Murphy.

"Will you allow me to read a few words to
you from the Bible, Mrs. McCrankum?" asked
the young lady.

"Kathleen McCrankum could niver refuse to
hear your lovely voice, sure," was the reply.
And almost before permission was given by his
!!!!! 095.txt !!!!!
mother, Barney had handed his Bible to
Florence, with another bow. "Be off wi' ye,
childer!" said the mother to Katie and Norah.
"Ye're not wanted here at all."

"Do let them remain here, Mrs. McCrankum,"
pleaded Florence. The warm hearted woman
really loved and admired Florence exceedingly.
So her request was granted, with the command
that they were "jist to go an' look out o' the
windy, while the leddy talked, an' not keep
lookin' at her, with their saucy, starin' eyes."
Mrs. McCrankum had a double reason, however,
for trying to divert their attention. She was
highly prejudiced against the teaching about to
be administered to herself, although she would
not refuse to receive it from her favourite
Florence. And she wished them to remain in
ignorance of its purport. But while Katie and
Norah looked out of the window, they heard
Florence read words of truth about the "High
Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus," who is
"able to save them to the uttermost that come
!!!!! 096.txt !!!!!
unto God BY HIM, seeing He ever liveth to
make intercession for them." And those words
went home to their hearts, although they made
no comment on them just then.

"With such a High Priest we need no other,"
remarked Florence, quietly.

Murphy drew the back of his hand across his
eyes. He was thinking of the snowdrops, and
wondering how much farther their lesson would
spread. From Sunshine in dear old England
to himself, next to his beloved wife, (who had
gone over to "wait for him,") then to Barney.
And now, through Barney's anxiety, the sweet,
"old story"--or rather most precious old truth--was
being told in the ears of three other persons,
who, in God's own time, he prayed might feel
its beauty and priceless worth.

"Me darlint leddy!" exclaimed Mrs. McCrankum.
"Ye're like an angel sure!" Norah
slipped away from her place at the window,
and shyly crept nearer to Florence, with
her eyes fixed thoughtfully upon the young
!!!!! 097.txt !!!!!
lady's face. After Murphy had added his
testimony to that of Florence, in his own simple
manner, they departed. And when Katie and
Norah were left alone, they held a conversation
together, which resulted in the declaration, on
both sides, that "Miss Floarance knew better
than the prastes." And that "Barney knew
better too." And that it was "kind an' lovely,
of the Lord Jesus Christ to come down from
heaven, and be crucified for the world." And
added Katie,

"I'll jist ask Barney to tell me more about
Him, and read to me out of the Bible."
!!!!! 098.txt !!!!!




CHAPTER XII.

MEETING AT THE GRAVE.


A few years roll by, and
again we find business summoning
Mr. Ross to England.
This time, however,
Mrs. Ross and Florence
decided to accompany him.
When all preparations were made, and the
hour for starting had arrived, Murphy and
Watch saw the family go on board. The
ponderous steamer was released from her
moorings, and she began to cleave her way
through the water.  Florence stood on deck
!!!!! 099.txt !!!!!
waving her handkerchief. And as the vessel
receded from Murphy's view, he flourished his
hat over his head with one hand, while he
stroked the beautiful head of the dog with the
other Watch had raised himself upon his
hind-feet and placed his fore-feet on an old
boat, that he, too, might see the last wave of the
handkerchief.

Away, away, the steamer darted, from the
huge Continent, with its gigantic rivers and
mountains, and its bold wild scenery, to the
little home-land on the other side. And as it
made its way, and our passengers could see
nothing but a wondrous expanse of water
beneath and around, and far off sky above, it
was no wonder that their thoughts should revert
to their native Island. Long, long before they
reached it, they heard in imagination its cattle
lowing, and sheep bells tinkling. They saw its
cosy homes, where so many mothers found
their constant joy in strengthening the hands
and hearts of their husbands, and bringing up
!!!!! 100.txt !!!!!
their children in the "nurture and admonition
of the Lord."

*****

The last words from Mr. Ross to Murphy were--"I
will be sure to attend to your child's grave."

Accordingly, as soon as the old home was
reached, his promise was fulfilled. The family
visited their own home first; the pond and the
willow looked precisely as they had done years
before. In the churchyard they found the
grave. Mr. Ross examined it, and as Mrs.
Ross was tired, she sat there with Florence,
while he went away to speak to some workmen
concerning it. Scarcely had he left the churchyard
when a voice was heard singing. They
listened. It was as ringing and clear as a child's
voice, though its power and fulness were that of
a woman's. Distinctly they heard the words--

"Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
Nor can the memory find,
A sweeter sound than Thy blest name,
Oh! Saviour of mankind."
!!!!! 101.txt !!!!!
[Illustration]

"A ROSY MAIDEN..........WAS SEEN APPROACHING."--Page 107.
!!!!! 102.txt !!!!!
[Blank Page]
!!!!! 103.txt !!!!!
Again, and again, with unmistakeable feeling,
the words were repeated.

"It is the voice of a girl, I think," said Mrs.
Ross, as she looked round, but perceived no
one. The next moment a rosy maiden, apparently
a little younger than Florence, was seen
approaching. A large hat shaded her round
pleasant face; and in her hand was a basket
of fresh gathered flowers. She looked startled,
and ceased to sing, when she saw strangers;
then appeared disposed to turn back, but altered
her mind, and kneeling down beside the very
grave Mr. and Mrs. Ross had come to inspect,
commenced to decorate it, with the flowers she
had brought, saying, as she did so,--

"I didn't know that any ladies were here,
ma'am. I am only just a-goin' to put a few
fresh flowers on this grave."

"Pray do not let us prevent you doing so,"
returned Mrs. Ross. "We shall be glad if you
let us see how you place them."

The rosy face grew more rosy, and a set of
!!!!! 104.txt !!!!!
white teeth were displayed, as their owner
said,

"Thank you, ma'am," and went on with her
pleasing task.

"You surely cannot remember the little girl
who is buried there?" said Mrs. Ross, enquiringly,
as she watched the busy fingers.

"No, ma'am, but I remember her father."

"Indeed!"

"Yes I do," with a slight quiver in the voice.
"Yes I do," she repeated, as she tied some
lilies of the valley and a blush rose together,
with a piece of striped grass.

"So do I," was the quiet answer.

"Do you, ma'am!" returned the girl eagerly,
adding, "I liked him very much when he lived
here; that's why I bring flowers for this grave."

"You would like him quite as well if you
knew him now."

"Do you know him, ma'am?"

"Yes, quite well."

"But he went to America with a gentleman
!!!!! 105.txt !!!!!
called Mr. Ross, that used to live in a large
house here." Evidently the girl did not imagine
it possible that the lady before her had ever
travelled so far as America and back, so she
seemed to conclude it was a mistake: it could
not be her Mr. Murphy that she knew.

"Mrs. Murphy went with him," she continued.

"Yes."

"And I did hear that she was dead."

"She is dead. But she trusted in the Saviour,
and loved Him; so now she enjoys eternal life
with Him."

The busy fingers became idle, and the bright
eyes were fixed upon the face of Mrs. Ross.

"That's what he taught me, ma'am, and
that's why I remember him. I taught him to
read the Bible, because I went to school and
knew how; and he used to talk to me about the
Saviour."

"Then while you were teaching him to read,
he was the means of making you love what you
and he read together."
!!!!! 106.txt !!!!!
"Yes, ma'am."

"Do you live at home with your parents?"

"They are dead. Father died when I was a
little child, and mother died after Mr. Murphy
went away. I live with my aunt. She lets me
come and bring flowers here very often. She
wants to put me out to service, only she can't
hear of a situation."

"Have you no brothers nor sisters?"

"No, ma'am."

"Would you like to go to America, and take
a situation near to Mr. Murphy?"

"Oh, I should! but that can't be, it's too
far away. And I think America's a big place;
perhaps if I went I should not be able to find
him."

At that moment, Mr. Ross was seen coming
towards the group. The girl looked steadily at
him until he drew near, then suddenly exclaimed,

"Squire Ross!"

"My name is Ross, too," said the lady, "and
this is our daughter."
!!!!! 107.txt !!!!!
"What, Miss Florence! that Mr. Murphy
so often used to tell me about?"

"Yes, the same. We have just come from
America; Mr. Murphy is quite well, and will
be delighted to hear what you have just told
me."

The girl dropped her basket, and stood for
some moments like one petrified; then picked
it up, and said,--

"I beg your pardon for being so bold,
ma'am. I never thought I was talking to Mrs.
Ross and Miss Florence."

Iron rails were placed round the grave;
it was fresh turfed, and the head-stone renovated.
Afterwards, Mr. Ross attended to the
business about which he had come to England,
and in due course of time the family returned.
They had an addition, however, in the rosy
English maiden, who gladly assented to a proposal
which they made to her, to go back with
them as their servant.

They found that hers was not "eye-service,"
!!!!! 108.txt !!!!!
she was faithful in every particular. Evidently
the love of God was "shed abroad in her
heart." Young as she was, Christianity was
the rule of her life: and that is saying a great
deal for her. She proved a treasure to them on
their passage, and a greater treasure still when
they reached the land where "helps" are not
famous for helping.

Once more, Barney and his horses awaited
the arrival of the steamer from England; and
delighted was he when he returned through
Broadway with the family, safely seated in the
carriage. With what a flourish did he drive up
to the door of his master's house! and how
proudly "the boy" and his companion horse
champed their bits, and tossed their sleek heads,
while they stood to allow the party to alight!

Barney said, "The beautiful crathurs knew
all about it, sure. An' didn't they turn their
lovely heads an' whinny, while they heard the
masther's voice agin. Sure, they knew he'd
bin out, an' they knew he'd come home."
!!!!! 109.txt !!!!!
When Barney reached home, he exclaimed to
his wife, "Now, me jewel, she is come, sure!"

"Who?" asked Ellen.

"Why, a new lady's-maid from England.
An' she's a'most as han'some as you are yourself.
Wi' two big, bright eyes; an' two cheeks
like rosy apples; an' two rows of teeth as
white as the pearl buttons on yer clane, purty
cuffs, now." And Barney lifted his wife's
hand, to shew[**show?] her the pearl buttons on her
"clane, purty cuffs," as if she had never seen
them before.

"Where have you left father?" asked Ellen.
They always called Murphy "father" now.

"Sure, I left him at the masther's, having
his tea wi' the new jewel from England--it's
Martha, her name is--and whin she wint into
the house first of all, I niver saw anybiddy so
glad and sorry-looking at the same time before,
in all me life, as the poor ould man was. He
shook both her hands at one an' the same minnit,
and thin, I thought he'd faint, sure! for
!!!!! 110.txt !!!!!
he jist sat down on a chair, and looked like a
sheet o' writing paper. An' the mistress
happened to step in jist thin, an' she looked
scared at the first sight o' him, all white an'
tremblin'. An' she jist opened the windy, an'
bathed his head wi' her own two purty white
hands, till he got better an' lively agin. An'
I heard her whisper to the young girl--'He is
overjoyed at seeing you here, he will soon be
better.'

"But----" continued Barney, while his
usually merry face clouded.

"But what, Barney?"

"Well, niver mind, me darlint, niver mind.
He's glad enough to see her, an' hear the news
as she brings him. An' I'll tell you all about
it, whin we sit down to tea. It's the beautiful
snowdrops over agin. They're jist puttin' on
new blossoms all the time. But the first one is
dying off, sure, that's plain to me; an' it's no
use to be pinin' an' frettin' about it. But we'll
miss him, sure! We'll miss him!"
!!!!! 111.txt !!!!!
"What do you mean, Barney?" asked his
wife. As she spoke she looked up, and perceived
that he was really grieved; and at once
comprehended the whole matter. Murphy was
growing very feeble, and Barney thought he
would soon die.

"We shall miss him," she returned, "when
he goes; but perhaps God will not take him so
soon as you think. And let him die whenever
he may, he will be 'for ever with the Lord.'
So we must try and not fret, though he is
getting weak and worn."

Ellen seated herself at the tea-table as she
spoke; and Barney related to her the history of
Martha Stanley, so far as he had heard it from
herself and Murphy, in the few minutes he had
just spent with them at his master's house.
!!!!! 112.txt !!!!!
CHAPTER XIII.

THE OLD MAN RESTS.

Months have passed since
Martha's arrival from England
with the Ross family;
and now sweet spring is
sending out her heralds
in the form of early flowers,
and transient bursts of sunshine. The streets
are all life and bustle, showing that the spring
trade is setting in, and last, not least to many
persons in New York, the shop windows are
filled with light dresses for the coming season.

Our old friend is rejoicing very much over
!!!!! 113.txt !!!!!
HIS dress. It is a splendid one truly; and so
costly, that were it not already purchased for
him, the crown jewels of England, the Koh-i-nor
and the Shah of Persia's gems together,
would be insufficient to secure it. It fits
perfectly; not only on him, but on every one
who will accept it, "without money and without
price." But we will pay him a visit. At
this moment he seems to be the sole occupant
of a pretty bed room. A large easy chair in
which he is seated, is drawn near the window.
Beside him is a little table; and upon it, a
white card, imprinted on which in black letters,
are the words:

"Jesu, Thy blood and righteousness
My beauty are, my glorious dress;
Midst flaming worlds in these arrayed,
With joy shall I lift up my head.

"When from the dust of death I rise
To claim my mansion in the skies,
E'en then, shall this be all my plea
Jesus hath lived and died for me.
!!!!! 114.txt !!!!!
"This spotless robe the same appears
When ruined nature sinks in years;
No age can change its lovely hue;
It's glory is for ever new."

Ah! then it is an invisible dress! Yet, not
quite so either; for the calm, happy light in
the eyes dimmed by age, tells plainly of the
"peace of God" dwelling in the heart. We
can read in that placid face an expression which
says:

"The Lord is my Shepherd;
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
He leadeth me beside the still waters."

Yes, he is walking along with his feeble,
time-worn hand clasped in the mighty, tender
hand of God. Not looking behind him or
beneath his feet for causes of danger; but
simply "looking off unto Jesus, the author and
finisher of faith."

A blue-eyed, flaxen-haired little girl enters
the room with the words, "Good mornin',
!!!!! 115.txt !!!!!
Misther Murphy. Me mother's respects to you,
an' will yer plase 'xcept this little jar of
preserved fruit?"

Murphy kissed the child, and expressed his
thanks for her mother's kindness. The little
one was Barney's sister, Norah. Mrs. McCrankum
knew that Murphy had no actual need of
any kind; but this was the warm-hearted
woman's way of showing her gratitude and
sympathy. And she seemed to overlook the
fact that she was displaying it towards one who
was styled by her church "a heretic." Indeed
her views respecting heresy were changing.

Nearly three years had passed since she,
with her husband and family, had landed in
New York, and during that time Barney and
others had very often prayed for her that she
might see and embrace "the truth." Forcible
passages of Scripture had been put before her,
and she had pondered over them and felt their
weight. But we return to Norah.

"An' will you be too tired to talk this
!!!!! 116.txt !!!!!
mornin', Misther Murphy?" The pretty blue
eyes were lifted to his face with an earnest
expression.

"That all depends, little darling, upon what
you want me to talk about. I am never too tired
to talk about some things."

"Plase to talk about anything you like thin,
sir."

"Well, I'll talk about God's love and care,
Norah. But first listen, while I tell you of
something which I saw when I lived in old
England. Somehow I remember things that
happened years ago there, better than I do the
things which have happened since I have lived
in New York.

"I knew a park which was owned by a rich
gentleman who had a fancy for foreign birds--I
mean waterfowl. There was plenty of
ornamental water about the place, and it was
well stocked with all sorts of beautiful birds. A
pair of these strayed from their home, and took
up their abode in a pond belonging to another
!!!!! 117.txt !!!!!
gentleman's estate in the neighbourhood; this
pond had lots of reeds and rushes all round the
banks, and a great many wild plants grew there
too. The birds could hide themselves amongst
these when anyone was about; but when all was
still, and no one to be seen, they would come out
and swim. One day, when I was weeding some
flower-beds at a little distance, out came the
mother bird with three little ones. Of course
she did not know I was there, or she would not
have ventured. They were like pretty balls of
down; and it was astonishing how well they
swam. But it was plain enough that this was
not their first attempt at swimming. She did
not seem very anxious about them either, until
they reached the middle of the pond; then I
noticed that one of the three was weaker and
smaller than the others; and it began to call
and pine, poor little thing, in its way. In a
moment the mother began to bustle about and
answer it. Then she lifted one wing a little: the
young one darted underneath; and she, with it
!!!!! 118.txt !!!!!
propped up somehow safe and comfortable, and
the other two swimming behind her, made
for the bank. When she reached it, they all disappeared
together amongst the reeds and rushes."

"An' did she get it safe home?" eagerly asked
Norah.

"Safe home! Yes, to be sure she did. Trust
her for that, my little one."

"What a darlint mother she was thin, to be
after liftin' the jewel o' a bird and carryin' it along
so beautiful, whin it was tired." The old man
smiled as he said, "HE shall cover thee with His
feathers, and under His wings shalt thou trust."

"An' what does that mane, Misther Murphy?"

"It means that the great God is loving and
tender, more so than a mother, to all His children,
guiding and supporting them as watchfully as
that mother-bird did her young. Only He is so
much fonder, aye, and so much stronger."

"It was the same One who sent His darlint
Son to die for us, wasn't it, sir?"

"Yes, the same One, the same One," re-*
!!!!! 119.txt !!!!!
*peated the old man, as though he loved to
dwell upon the words. "Oh, yes, it is the same
One. 'God is love,' and Jesus is 'the same
yesterday, to-day,[**Added hyphen.] and for ever.'" Evidently
he was thinking aloud, for his words meant far
more than the little child beside him could be
expected to understand. But Norah caught at
the word "Jesus," and asked Murphy to tell
her about some of the things that He did when
He lived on the earth. Murphy drew her close
to his side and told her the "sweet story" of the
Saviour's life and death in simple words, which
were easily understood. Then came a pause.
The old man was evidently in deep thought.
Presently, he continued--

"And soon these dim old eyes shall see Him.
Yes, see Him! And I am so glad. You cannot
tell how glad I am at the prospect of going
home. Your young limbs are so active, and you
are so full of life. Oh no, you cannot tell how glad
I feel about it." Then taking the child's fair,
rosy cheeks in his withered palms, he said--
!!!!! 120.txt !!!!!
"God bless you, little Norah! and make you
His own child, for Christ's sake."

"I always pray straight to God, and ask Him
to, when I go to bed at night. Barney taught
me that."

"What do you say when you pray?"

"I say 'Our Father' all through; an' thin I say,

"Gentle Jesus meek and mild
Look upon a little child,
Pity my si'plicity
Suffer me to come to thee. Amen."

"And doesn't your mother object to your
praying like that?"

"No sir, me mother comes an' hears me say it
ivery night; and thin she kisses me, and tucks me
up in bed." Murphy smiled, but said nothing.

"Good bye, Misther Murphy, an' thank ye,
sir. Me mother said I musn't stay too long to
make you tired."

"You'll remember what I have just told you,
Norah, won't you?"

"Sure, I'll niver, niver forget it."
!!!!! 121.txt !!!!!

"And if they tell you soon that I am no
longer living, you musn't grieve; because God
holds me safe, and He will surely take me to a
beautiful home, where I shall never feel pain and
sorrow any more."

"I'll try and not cry," said Norah, while the
tears were running down her cheeks.

"Remember the mother-bird, little one."

"Sure I do. And you said God was like that,
only so much better. An' I s'pose He'll just
take an' lift you away, soft and kind, like she
did the pretty bird that was weak." The old
man smoothed the child's hair, but his eyes were
fixed upon the clear, blue sky.

"Won't He, Misther Murphy?" and she
stroked the back of his hand. "Won't He now?"

"Yes, my darling, yes. He will lift me away,
'soft and kind,' as you say. Oh yes, gently
enough! that He will."

"Good afternoon, sir," said Norah, who had
been bravely trying to hide her tears, and found
that retreat was her only means of doing so.
!!!!! 122.txt !!!!!

"Good bye, Norah; God bless you!" She
never saw Murphy again, for that evening, when
the sun was going down, all who had long and
tenderly cared for him gathered about his bed.
Martha Stanley was among them. And naturally
enough, she seemed to be an object of
special interest and affection to him. Was she
not his own child in the faith? After lying still
for some time, he opened his eyes, fixed them
upon her, and said,

"I pray that God will keep you close to
Himself, my child, as long as you live." His
voice failed, and the girl bowed her head upon
his pillow as she said:--

"For Jesus Christ's sake, Amen." A
touch from Mrs. Ross caused her to raise herself,
but the beloved friend who had taught her
to offer her petitions in the name of Jesus, had
departed to be with Him.

"Oh death, where is thy sting?
Oh grave, where is thy victory?"
!!!!! 123.txt !!!!!
CHAPTER XIV.

HOME AGAIN.

Two uneventful years passed
after the death of Murphy,
then brave Watch died.
With his beautiful head
resting upon the lap of his
young mistress, who had
seated herself on the hearth-rug beside him, he
closed his eyes for the last time, apparently
without pain. Florence sat there weeping over
him for some minutes; then Mr. Ross said,--

"Do not grieve so, my child! You have one
great comfort in the matter. You have not to
!!!!! 124.txt !!!!!
reproach yourself with careless or unkind
treatment of the poor old dog at any time in
his life."

"I should feel sorry indeed, papa, now I see
Watch dead before me, if I had ever treated
him ill. Good Watch! Noble Watch!" And
Florence smoothed the glossy head of the
animal as she spoke, then gently removed it
from her lap and took her seat beside her papa,
who said as she did so:--

"'Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?
and one of them shall not fall to the ground
without your Father.' Remember, dear Florrie,
the God who marks the fall of a sparrow, holds
the breath of every living creature in His
mighty hand; when 'He takes away their
breath they die,' and only then."

Old Watch was borne from the room as
tenderly as though the still handsome but rigid
limbs could feel every touch, and Barney laid
him gently in his grave. After he had done so
he stepped in home and said to his wife,
!!!!! 125.txt !!!!!

"Sure, I've a consate about that grave. I'll
jist keep it illigant and plant some snowdrops
on it. For it's asy to see that the dog, and the
jewel o' a young lady, an' Murphy, an' the
snowdrops, are somehow twisted togither in me
head." Barney's wife could hardly see the
gist of her husband's remark at first. But she
did not ask for explanation, lest it should increase
her bewilderment. She thought for a
few moments, and arrived at the conclusion
that there was in her husband's mind a link
of association between Florrie and her snowdrops,
the rescue from the pond, and so on.
She was right. But it was easier for Barney
to say "twisted togither" than associated.

*****

Beautiful snowflakes are falling. Icicles
hang from the eaves of many of old England's
cottages. Ruddy school children hurry over
their morning meal that they may rush out
of doors and greet each other with volleys of
snow balls.
!!!!! 126.txt !!!!!

"Hurrah! I have caught you!" shouts a
boy, as he delightedly sees another shake the
snow from his jacket, and scramble to prepare
a return snow-ball still larger than the one he
had just received.

"I'll tell my mother if you throw one at me,
I will," cries one, a little girl, as she rapidly
retreats.

"Who is going to snowball a girl?" returns
the boy, as he flings another double hand-full
at his masculine play-fellow.

Thus they beguile the time and forget the
cold, until a gentleman is seen approaching;
and the watch-word goes from mouth to mouth--"Here's
the master! Here's the master!"
And at the Master's heels they enter the schoolhouse.

Now the short winter day is waning. The
boys at the school have passed their Christmas
examination, and the one who was too manly
to snowball a girl has gained a handsome prize
for general good conduct and application. And
!!!!! 127.txt !!!!!
as he carries it proudly along the road from
school to show his mother, two or three of his
schoolfellows join him, and suddenly they are
attracted by a bright light coming from the
windows of a large house, which lies back in an
oak-fenced enclosure.

"Look here, Charlie!" cries one in a half
whisper, half shout. "Look through that window,
isn't it nice to be them?"

"What are they doing?" enquires Charlie,
as he peers over the fence, and through the
bare branches of the laburnums into the cheerful
room where a large fire is burning.

"I wonder they don't draw the blinds
down?" remarks the first speaker.

"Perhaps they would if they knew we
were looking at them," returns Charlie,
adding, "why, don't you know who they are,
Tom?"

"Not I. Do you?"

"Of course I do. My mother knew them
before you were born, or me either."
!!!!! 128.txt !!!!!

"One, two, three, four. There are four of
them," said Tom.

"Yes. That is the master and missis, and
the young lady and her husband."

"Do they all live there together?"

"Why you must have been asleep, Tom!
Havn't you seen that house that is being built
a stone's throw down the road?"

"Yes, of course. But what of that?"

"Why it's for them, to be sure. The young
lady and her husband, I mean. She was born
in this house that we are looking at; and they
have been living in America ever so many
years. And she was married just before they
left there. They are very rich too, and used to
do a lot of good when they lived here before."

"How old are you, Charlie?"

"Fourteen last birthday. What do you
mean?"

"Why you are so wise. Anybody would
think you had known these gentry before they
went away."
!!!!! 129.txt !!!!!

"Well, my mother has told me all about
them, that's how I know."

"What is their name?"

"Why the name is Ross. But I don't know
the young lady's name now she's married. I
have heard her husband is a doctor."

After this conversation the school-boys trudged
home. We will not follow them. We will enter
the room where sit Mr. and Mrs. Ross, Florence
and her husband. It is only twelve months
since Watch died, and six months since Florrie's
wedding. Mr. Ainsley, her husband, is a
gentleman in every way worthy of her,--as
devoted and consistent a Christian as she is
herself. With such a friend and companion
through life, she cannot fail to be happy. And
persons so well matched, both leaning upon
God for strength always, cannot fail to spread
happiness around them. The "peace of God"
in their own hearts, sends them forth, yearning,
to draw others to the same blessed resting-place
at the feet of Jesus. But we enter the room.
!!!!! 130.txt !!!!!

"I must go and ask Barney whether it is
advisable to take the horses out in the morning,"
said Mr. Ross. "I must get to London somehow;
but I fear the roads are too slippery to
allow us to drive." Away walked the gentleman
to his servant's house inside the grounds, and
in reply to his master's query respecting the
safety of the roads, Barney said,

"Sure yer honour, I'll get the jewels roughshod,
an' I'll drive them as careful as me wife
steps about whin I am ill. They'll be as tinder
as a lady's hand, them beauties will, if they are
kept in out o' ivery bit o' snow and ice." In
the morning, when Barney was starting to
London with his master, he remarked: "Sure,
the boy got more knowinger ivery day he got
oulder," adding, "I tould him last night that
he must go out in the mornin,' and he jist gave
a little, soft neigh, an' rubbed his head agin me
shoulder, the darlint! as much as to say,

'Sure an' I'll go if ye'll go wi' me, masther?'
Thrue for him, the beauty! He'd thry to swim
!!!!! 131.txt !!!!!
across the big sea to New York wi' me if I
asked him." Safely enough Barney brought his
master and the horses home that day. And
when the evening came on, and the family was
nearly ready to retire, the servants were summoned
as usual for evening prayer.

Amongst them came rosy Martha Stanley and
flaxen-haired Norah McCrankum. Norah loved
her father and mother dearly. Still she had chosen
to accept Florrie's invitation to come to England
!!!!! 132.txt !!!!!
with her as her waiting-maid. And the
promise was given to Mrs. McCrankum before
they left America, that should the girl wish to
return at any time, she should at once be sent.
Mr. Ross commenced reading the Scripture portion
for the evening, in the first Epistle of John,
third chapter and first verse. "Behold what
manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon
us, that we should be called the sons of God."

When Florrie was having her hair arranged
by Norah before retiring to rest, she perceived
tears in her waiting-maid's eyes.

"What is amiss, Norah?" she asked, kindly.

"I was thinkin', me leddy, about the chapter
that the masther read about the 'sons of God,'
an' how happy it is to be a real child of God!"

"But do you not feel that you are a child of
God, Norah?"

"I feel, me leddy, that I can jist walk along
wi' me hand in His, an' me eyes lookin' straight
up to Him, an' tell Him all that's in me heart
like I would tell me own mother."
!!!!! 133.txt !!!!!

"I am thankful to hear you say so, Norah.
And your mother,--do you think she has the
same confidence?"

"The very last words me mother said to me
whin I left her in America were, 'Norah me
honey! I love yer wi' all me heart. An' I
wouldn't advise yer to do a thing that would
hurt yer. An' I tell yer to keep fast hold o' the
Misthress' taychin'; an' Miss Florrie's, an'
Barney's. For it's right, an' I know it. An
remember, honey, that while your jist sayin' your
prayers to God through the Lord Jesus, and
puttin' all your trust in Him, an' rading the
blessed Book for yourself in England; your
mother will be doin' the same thing in America.
An' He'll listen to us both, though the big sea
rolls betwane us."

"And do you think your father believes in
the truth?"

"I jist believe, ma'am, he's trusting the same
way as mother, only he's so quiet-like about it.
An' Katy, the darlint! I know well enough
!!!!! 134.txt !!!!!
what she thinks. Many an' many's the hour
Katy an' I have read the Bible togither. An'
Katy found the truth in it as plain as I did. An'
she believes it too."

After Norah had left her, Florence went to
her mother's dressing-room and repeated to her
the conversation that had just passed. As she
ceased speaking, Mrs. Ross remarked,

"The words of truth that first, under God,
touched the heart of Murphy, came from your
lips,--from Murphy the teaching and influence
reached his wife and Martha Stanley,--then
extended to Barney,--from Barney to his mother
and sisters,--and doubtless, in God's good time,
the whole of that family will be made the subjects
of it. How far it may spread from them is
altogether beyond our power to tell. Oh, Florrie,
my child, a word fitly spoken for Jesus, or an
act of kindness done in His name, brings forth
'an hundredfold' more often than we are apt to
think. The grain of wheat in the 'good ground'
brings forth its ear, the ear sheds its accumulated
!!!!! 135.txt !!!!!
grains, and in process of time, if we could trace
the growing increase, we should find a glorious
harvest from that tiny seedling."

We do not often trace these things and watch
their progress year after year. But He whose
"eyes behold," and "whose eye-lids try the children
of men," takes account. It is all graven in
a rock--as it were--by His mighty hand. And
such service is well-pleasing in His sight, even
though it be the effort of the veriest little one.

"And they that be wise shall shine as the
brightness of the firmament; and they that turn
many to righteousness as the stars for ever and
ever."

But to conclude our story. Shortly after this
the members of the household retired to sleep.
"Behold He that keepeth Israel shall neither
slumber nor sleep." And resting upon Him,
we leave them.
